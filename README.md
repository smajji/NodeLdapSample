A sample Node.js web application that implements LDAP/AD authentication for client login using passport, Express and Jade.


## Usage
    * Make sure you have Node.js installed.
    * clone https://github.com/smajji/NodeLdapSample.git or clone your own fork.
    * cd NodeLdapSample
    * npm install
    * node app.js

Your app should now be running on localhost:8999.

Ldap Configuration in route.js needs to be replaced with your own LDAP/AD configuration.
